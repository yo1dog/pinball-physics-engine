# Pinball Physics Engine
A physics engine specifically created for pinball games.

This is a physics engine that I wrote completely from scratch. It uses a mix of vector math and trig to calculate
collisions and projections. It has a very specific purpose: to power pinball simulations.

The project started just as an interest in building a physics engine. At some point I decided I wanted to build some
kind of pinball game and the project shifted towards that goal.
